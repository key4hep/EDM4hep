  - Add a script to create an EDM4hep file. The script is in python and can be called like `python createEDM4hepFile.py`. I have tried to make use of every member and relation in the data model. The purpose is to have something that can create quickly an EDM4hep file and because the script is in python no compilation is needed, hopefully lowering the barrier to get to an EDM4hep file. People can adapt it to their needs or use it as an example for testing, debugging, etc.

  - Remove some of the drift chamber study types that were introduced in [#179](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/179) again since they need a bit more consideration
    - The removed types and components are: `Hypothesis`, `HitLevelData`, `RecIonizationCluster`, `SimPrimaryIonizationCluster`, `TrackerPulse`
    - Keep the types and components that are already in use, mainly `TimeSeries`
  - Remove the usage of the removed components from `RecDqdx` to make it a purely reconstruction level type
  - Fix script that checks that all types are part of the json dumper

* 2024-06-28 tmadlener ([PR#331](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/331))

  - Add a `GeneratorToolInfo` struct and related utility functionality to store some high level metadata on the generator into Frame parameters.

* 2024-06-17 tmadlener ([PR#315](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/315))
  - Introduce the `edm4hep::labels` namespace to hold the string constants that are used for consistent labeling / naming of collections or parameters.
    - Use this opportunity to homogenize the naming and capitalization of the variables but leave string constants unchanged
  - Deprecate existing string constants

  - To have a more consistent way of filling the `algoType` in the `edm4hep::utils::ParticleIDMeta` use the 32 bit version of MurmurHash3 to hash the `algoName` to get to `algoType`. Fixes #298 
    - Make `algoType` a private member but allow read access to it via the `algoType` member function. `algoType` has to be filled on construction. It is still possible to set it manually, the hashing will only kick in for the constructor taking only a name.

* 2024-05-01 tmadlener ([PR#287](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/pull/287))
  - Introduce `edm4hep::CovMatrix[2,3,4,6}f` components to represent covariance matrices
    - using `std::array<float, N>` under the hood
    - Access functionality that works on enums for defining dimensions and some utilities to do the indexing into the underlying storage
  - Introduce some `enum class`es for defining dimensions, e.g. `TrackParams` or `Cartesian`
  - Use these components instead of the raw `std::array`s in datatypes and other components and tie the interpretation of the values to the approriate dimension `enum class`
  
  Usage example:
  ```cpp
  #include "edm4hep/TrackerHit3D.h"
  
  void foo(const edm4hep::TrackerHit3D& hit) {
    const auto covXY  = hit.getCovMatrix(edm4hep::Cartesian::x, edm4hep::Cartesian:y);

  - Fix capitalization in edm4hep.yaml: pDG -> PDG

* 2020-08-19 tmadlener ([PR#69](https://github.com/key4hep/edm4hep/pull/69))
  - Add additional comment to `mass`, `energy` and `momentum` members of `ReconstructedParticle` description to clearly state that the 4-momentum state is not automatically kept consistent internally. Since there are too many different use-cases, a general solution that always works was deemed hard to achieve and it is, thus, the users responsibility to keep this state consistent if it is necessary.

* 2020-08-11 tmadlener ([PR#56](https://github.com/key4hep/edm4hep/pull/56))
  - Add a converter module for delphes that can output edm4hep files. The module is used in several standalone delphes executables that take different input formats (e.g. stdhep, pythia8, etc.) and **standard delphes cards** and produce edm4hep output root files. It can also be used in conjunction with gaudi. **This is an early release to gather feedback and to iterate on that feedback. Currently not all of the input readers that come with standard delphes are implemented and also the information content of the edm4hep files is restricted to the most important information. More information can be added on demand.** A brief introduction and some examples are included.
